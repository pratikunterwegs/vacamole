\arguments{
\item{times}{vector of time points}

\item{params}{list of parameter values}

\item{criteria}{criteria by which to change contact matrix.
User can choose between a number of cases per day or a number of IC
admissions.}

\item{flag_relaxed}{an integer value that becomes non-zero (positive) when
the contact matrix consistent with "relaxed" non-pharmaceutical interventions
is being used.}

\item{flag_very_relaxed}{an integer value that becomes non-zero (positive)
when the contact matrix consistent with "very relaxed" non-pharmaceutical
interventions is being used.}

\item{flag_normal}{an integer value that becomes non-zero (positive) when the
contact matrix consistent with normal (pre-pandemic) contact patterns is
being used.}

\item{keep_fixed}{logical. if TRUE the contact matrix stays fixed over the
entire simulation period}
